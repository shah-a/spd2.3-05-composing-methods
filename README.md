# Refactoring: Composing Functions

In this series of exercises, we practice various refactoring techniques. You may want to run pylint on this script to find any pep8 compliance issues. Fix as much as issues you can.

- [x]  Exercise 1: 'Extract Function' Technique
  - Study the file [calculate_grades.py](calculate_grades.py). Use `extract function` technique to improve modularity of the code
  
- [x]  Exercise 2: 'Inline Function' Technique
  - Study the file [legal_drinking_age.py](legal_drinking_age.py). Use `inline function` technique to improve readability of the code. 
  
- [x]  Exercise 3: 'Replace Temp with query' Technique
  - Study the file [get_price.py](get_price.py). Use `Replace Temp with query` technique to improve readability of the code. 

- [x]  Exercise 4: 'Introducing Explaining Variable' Technique
  - Study the file [introduce_explaining_variable3.py](introduce_explaining_variable3.py). Use `Replace Temp with query` technique to improve readability of the code. 

- [x]  Exercise 5: 'Extract Function' Technique
  - Study the file '[distance_between_two_points.py](distance_between_two_points.py). Use `extract function` technique to improve modularity of the code. 

- [x]  Exercise 6: Various Techniques
  - Study the file [best_students.py](best_students.py). Use `Replace Temp with query` and `extract function` techniques to improve readability of the code. 

- [ ] Exercise 7: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique
  - Study the files [burger_toppings.py](burger_toppings.py) and use `split temporary variable` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

- [ ] Exercise 8: 'Remove Assignment to Method Parameter' Technique
  - Study the file [kinetic_energy.py](kinetic_energy.py). Use `remove assignment to method parameter` technique to prevent future mistakes/bugs.

- [ ] Exercise 9: 'Rename Method' Technique
  - Study the file [calculate_area.py](calculate_area.py). Use `rename method` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)

- [ ] Exercise 10: 'Split Temporary Variable' Technique
  - Study the file [save_to_db.py](save_to_db.py). Use `split temporary variable` technique to clarify the code (make it easier to understand its intent.)
